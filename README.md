# Webpack Multi-Page example

## Motivation
I'm very new on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and I've been working on a project for integrating some external apps with my company application and I was exploring the possibility to create a component that could behave as a multi-page application using React. After that, I had a conversation with a friend saying that I found out that Webpack was a very powerful tool. He told me that he always tought that Multi-page applications were not supported on Webpack. So this tiny example is to demonstrate how to use it in a Multi-page application.

## New exploration paths
I didn't try this with any template engine, any JS traspilation and how to support CSS. I think this could be solved exploring [Webpack Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/]).

## Dependencies:
- NodeJS >= v8.10.0 - https://nodejs.org/
- NPM >= 5.6.0  - https://www.npmjs.com/

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Building
```
npm run build
```

## Running
```
npm start
```
Now, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/. Check the app is up and running.
